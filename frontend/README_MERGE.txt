Merged frontend (best-effort)

What I did:
1. Used the 'ai-risk-yield-optimizer-frontend.zip' project as the UI base (copied entire project).
2. Merged package.json dependencies from both projects; the resulting package.json lives at top-level.
3. Scanned your original project ('frontend.zip') for files that contain absolute backend URLs (http:// or https://) and likely auth/api files.
   - These files were copied into 'src/legacy_api/' in this merged project so you won't lose any backend-call logic.
   - Files copied: package-lock.json, vite.config.ts, analytics.ts, risk.ts, yield.ts.

Why this is conservative:
- The target UI and the current app may use different component architectures and import paths. Automatically wiring imports across them can break runtime behavior.
- To avoid making incorrect changes that could break authentication or API calls, I preserved your functional API/auth files and placed them into src/legacy_api/.
- You (or I, if you request further) will need to:
  a) Inspect the UI components in 'src' (the target UI) and replace or import the necessary functions from 'src/legacy_api/' where API calls/auth are required.
  b) Update import paths in UI components to point to the copied service files (e.g. import { apiCall } from './legacy_api/apiService').
  c) Confirm environment variables for absolute URLs (if you want to switch to env-based URLs, move your 'http://...' strings into a .env file).

Quick manual steps to run:
1. cd merged_frontend
2. npm install
3. npm start

Notes & next steps I can do for you (pick any):
- I can attempt an automated wire-up: parse both projects for exported functions (e.g., login, fetchTasks) and replace references in the target UI automatically. This may require iterative fixes but I can try now.
- I can open specific components in the target UI and modify them to call your legacy API files (do this component-by-component).
- I can run (and test) the merged app here and fix runtime errors iteratively. This requires me to install dependencies (npm) which may be large; tell me if you want me to attempt that.

If you'd like the fully wired, runnable app now, say "Auto-wire and build" and I'll attempt to map exports/imports and run npm install/start here. Otherwise, download the merged zip and either run locally or tell me which components to wire first.
